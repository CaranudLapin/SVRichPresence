Due to restrictions within Mac and Linux, you will need to copy the Discord RPC
library from this mod's folder to the Stardew Valley folder. It is recommended
you do this every time you update the mod, but may not be required.

1. Install this mod like you would install any other Stardew Valley mod.
2. Locate and copy (or cut) this file from the mod's folder:
	a. For Mac: libdiscord-rpc.dylib
	b. For Linux: libdiscord-rpc.so
3. Open the main folder containing Stardew Valley.
	a. Right click Stardew Valley within Steam and click Properties.
	b. Click Local Files then Browse Local Files.
	c. A folder will open. If on Linux, this will be the game's folder.
	d. If on Mac, open Contents then MacOS to go to the game's folder.
4. Paste the copied file into the game's folder.
5. Start the game and hope it works.

===== Linux Troubleshooting =====

If you are on Linux and can't get Rich Presence to work, make sure you download
Discord from the official website (discordapp.com). Rich presence WILL NOT WORK
if Discord was downloaded from Ubuntu Software Centre! This is because Discord
on the Ubuntu Software Centre is packaged as a "snap app," which is sandboxed,
meaning other apps can't access it. While that's great for security, it will
prevent other applications from accessing Discord's rich presence functions.
