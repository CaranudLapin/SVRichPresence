Due to restrictions within Mac and Linux, you will need to copy the Discord RPC
library from this mod's folder to the Stardew Valley folder. It is recommended
you do this every time you update the mod, but may not be required.

Please note that the mod is mostly untested on platforms other than Windows 10.
I have gotten the mod to work on Mac but had no luck on Linux. However, these
steps are required for the mod to have ANY change of working on Mac and Linux.

1. Install this mod like you would install any other Stardew Valley mod.
2. Locate and copy (or cut) this file from the mod's folder:
	a. For Mac: libdiscord-rpc.dylib
	b. For Linux: libdiscord-rpc.so
3. Open the main folder containing Stardew Valley.
	a. Right click Stardew Valley within Steam and click Properties.
	b. Click Local Files then Browse Local Files.
	c. A folder will open. If on Linux, this will be the game's folder.
	d. If on Mac, open Contents then MacOS to go to the game's folder.
4. Paste the copied file into the game's folder.
5. Start the game and hope it works.
